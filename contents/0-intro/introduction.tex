\section{Introduction}

The aim of this document is to provide some test cases for the project
that was given us. We want to recall that the role of the Quality
Assurance is to help the developers to get a better product deleting
most of the bugs.

In this vision of the system, we tried to check various possible situations
in order to find uncorrect behaviours of the system.

Since the developers gave us a testing document, at least a few times,
we skipped the most trivial checks and we tried to check more particular
situations.

In this document we followed a simple pattern in which we examine
all the site functionalities we found in the RASD the developers gave
us, in particular we read the use case diagram and the list of the
scenarios. \\


Finally we want to cite one of the fathers of computer science, Dijkstra:
''Program testing can be used to show the presence of bugs, but never
to show their absence!''
